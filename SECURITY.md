## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We value the security of our cryptocurrency trading bot and appreciate your efforts in identifying and reporting potential vulnerabilities. To ensure responsible disclosure and prompt remediation, please follow these guidelines:

### Reporting Process

1.  **Identify the Vulnerability:** Clearly describe the vulnerability, including its type and potential impact.
2.  **Gather Evidence:** Provide detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any relevant code snippets, screenshots, or error messages.
3.  **Encrypt Sensitive Information:** If your report contains sensitive information (e.g., exploit code), please encrypt it using PGP encryption. Our PGP public key is available at [link to your PGP key].
4.  **Report the Vulnerability:** Send your vulnerability report to our security team at [your security email address].

### Severity Classification

To help us prioritize vulnerabilities, please use the following severity levels (based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)):

*   **Critical:** Vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access, data breach, or significant financial loss. (CVSS Score 9.0 - 10.0)
*   **High:** Vulnerabilities that have the potential for significant impact, but with some mitigation factors. (CVSS Score 7.0 - 8.9)
*   **Medium:** Vulnerabilities with moderate impact and potential for limited exploitation. (CVSS Score 4.0 - 6.9)
*   **Low:** Vulnerabilities with minimal impact and limited exploitability. (CVSS Score 0.1 - 3.9)

### Scope of Responsible Disclosure

We welcome reports on various types of vulnerabilities, including but not limited to:

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   SQL Injection
*   Authentication Bypass
*   Authorization Issues
*   Remote Code Execution
*   Denial of Service (DoS)

### Response and Remediation

We are committed to addressing reported vulnerabilities promptly. Our typical response timeline is as follows:

*   Acknowledgement: Within 24 hours of receiving a report.
*   Investigation: Within 72 hours of acknowledgement.
*   Fix: Within a reasonable timeframe, depending on the complexity of the vulnerability.
*   Communication: We will keep you informed about the progress of the investigation and remediation. Updates and patches will be communicated through our GitHub repository and other relevant channels.

### Safe Harbor

We will not take legal action against individuals who discover or report vulnerabilities in good faith.

### Responsible Reporting Practices

*   Do Not Publicly Disclose: Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been fixed.
*   Avoid Exploitation: Refrain from exploiting the vulnerability or accessing unauthorized data.
*   Focus on Security: Your report should focus on the security issue itself, not on unrelated functionality or performance concerns.

We value your contributions to the security of our project and appreciate your responsible disclosure practices.
